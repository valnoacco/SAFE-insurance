Methods (e.g. **Global Sensitivity Analysis**) and tools (e.g. the **SAFE toolbox**) to adequately capture uncertainty in mathematical models are available in academia, but tailored workflows and case studies (close to the area of expertise of model users) are needed to demonstrate their benefits and to accelerate their uptake in industry. 

The **objective of my fellowship** is to transfer methods, tools and expertise to improve the understanding and consideration of uncertainty in mathematical models used in the re-insurance industry. By better capturing uncertainty, we can achieve a more robust decision-making process, as the chance of unexpected surprises is reduced.

<br> 

## Activities I've done during my fellowship include:

In order to overcome the so-called “valley of death”[1](#ref1) (the gap between research development and uptake by industry) I have:

- developed [several case studies](https://safe-insurance.uk/Outputs.html) with re-insurance companies and model vendors, which demonstrate the benefit of using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to help the catastrophe model building process and forming their view of risk. 

- developed [training material](https://safe-insurance.uk/Outputs.html/#training_material)

- disseminated the knowledge gained through these case studies to the wider re/insurance sector through presentations and workshops at conference.
