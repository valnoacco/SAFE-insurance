I had problems of encoding because of that. \n\n- Make sure that you have enabled Git in RStudio. More information can be found [there](https://privefl.github.io/advr38book/good-practices.html#git).\n\n- You need a GitHub account.\n\n### Make the first version of your website\n\n- Fork this repo (top-right) and rename it to be 'YOURGITHUB.github.io' (in Settings of your brand new repo).\n\n- Get the link from cloning the repo. Use the green button \"Clone\" and make sure you use SSH, not HTTPS. Then, go to RStudio, create a New Project > Version Control > Git and copy this link. You have cloned your new repo as an R project.\n\n- Build the website by running `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = \"UTF-8\")` or just `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B`.\n\n- Commit and push everything from RStudio.\n\n- Go see your new website at https://YOURGITHUB.github.io/.\n\n### Change the content of your website\n\n- Modify `_site.yml`, `index.Rmd`, `about.Rmd`, `cv.Rmd` and `CV.pdf` with your own content. \n- Build your website again. At any moment, you can preview your website locally, by rendering your site and viewing any of your local html file in your Web Browser. \n\n- Commit and push everything from RStudio.\n\n- Go see your new website with your own content at https://YOURGITHUB.github.io/.\n\n### The blog part\n\nFor now, the 'Blog' link is giving a 404 page. \n\nIf you want to add a static blog to your webpage, go [there](https://github.com/privefl/jekyll-now-r-template).\n\n## Two examples\n\nYou can see for example \n- [my own website](https://privefl.github.io/),\n\n- [the website of the R user group in Grenoble](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs a reminder, all credit goes to the geniuses at RStudio (thanks also to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)). I just made some minor modifications and made a tuto about how to use all this together.\n\nIf anything is false or not clear enough, feel free to contact me or open an issue.\nIf it is an issue only related with R Markdown, you'll find a better answer posting [there](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown).\n",
